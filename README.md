Alfira is an application that lets you play sounds through a specified output device (or virtual cable) using customizable hotkeys. It runs in the background, so you can use it while gaming, streaming, or whatever 🙄💅.

What’s it all for? By mixing Alfira’s audio track with your microphone input, you can instantly trigger the perfect meme or music clip in response to what’s happening in voice chat. Or, you can even “speak” without using a microphone at all — just prepare a set of key phrases in advance.

# Usage
The main window displays a list of all sounds, allowing you to add, delete, or edit them.

Clicking the "Add Sound" button lets you select an .mp3 or .wav file. You can then assign it a name and a hotkey (automatically detected after pressing the Register Hotkey button), and optionally trim the audio (a visual waveform is displayed for convenience) or adjust its volume.

If needed, the edited sound is automatically converted to the appropriate format and copied into the application’s files.
